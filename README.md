Final Project for Humber College HTTP 5202
->Insert Description of Application here
Brad -
Create Profile functionality working.
Login was giving me issues for some reason in my database pull - I slept on it and did it later in the evening not sure the issue yet.
-Display profile is in process, but an absolute mess so I didn't add to push.

Sophia -
Comments, all CRUD working and can now be implemented on all pages but still need various components to be revised and completed by team to finalize.
Events, completed class and all forms required, need to implement functionality of the forms.
Found some things I feel need to be added in order for it to be feel complete, should have those finished for Phase 3.
In the process of displaying everything they way I want, all thats left is to add media and have other features linked properly in order to finalize layout design.
